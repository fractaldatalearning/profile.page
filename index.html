          <h2>About Me: Why Data Science and Support</h2>
           <p>As an educator, I've often been asked, "Did the participants learn?" The only possible answer is rote: "Yes, of course." Everybody is constantly learning something. I'm excited to explore questions such as: "What all have we been learning, explicitly or implicitly? Why &amp; how learn x on purpose rather than y some other way? Has learning happened differently or specifically thanks to my/our intentional efforts? Are we all learning what we want to learn, in ways that feel somehow right, for a purpose we care about?"
            <br><br>To answer these questions requires trusting collaboration among all members of a learning community, and it requires creative inquiry into rich sources of data. As an educational leader, my skills lie particularly in diagnosing needs in service of wise collective problem-solving. I've always utilized software with facility to aid in this process, but I want to play a more active role in communities making these resources available. This is why I am eager to expand on my strengths through the field of tech broadly and support and data science specifically. I want to be a part of asking important questions that help organizations change and thrive.
