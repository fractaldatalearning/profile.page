          <h2>About Me: Why Data Science and Support</h2>
            <p>I love collaborating to unearth  strategies for real change. As a teacher leader, I've supported young people and educators in connecting with our personal and collective efficacy. People I work with know what they want from institutions and how to get it because I hold space for data-driven, reflective conversations that bring everybody along for iterative cycles of strategic planning. Fostering this growth mindset is how we overcome barriers in an unjust society.
              <br><br>But limitations to living in the vision of our dreams need not even exist. I strive to use tech tools to find insights into root causes of barriers we face. Mutual tech education through data dives and support environments are the why and how of any organization's work. This intersection of data and tech support will be the base from which I draw sustenance as I work with my peers to transform our society. </p>
